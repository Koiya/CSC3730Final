Introduction 
Anime has become a global phenomenon, with countless genres and titles catering to diverse tastes. However, the sheer volume of available options makes it challenging for viewers to discover anime aligned with their preferences. A recommendation system tailored to anime fans can streamline this process, creating personalized viewing experiences while promoting lesser-known titles.

Problem Definition
The goal is to develop an effective anime recommendation algorithm using the MyAnimeList dataset.
This system should accurately predict animes based on another anime, ie content-based filtering. The challenges include handling sparse data, capturing anime nuances beyond genre, and ensuring scalability to accommodate a growing dataset.

Data analysis
First we process an anime list from MAL (MyAnimeList) which has all the titles, genres, episodes, etc. After processing the list, the data gets inputted to get model trained with content based filtering.
Then we wrote a content-based recommendation system which will fetch the animes that are similar to the inputted anime. The recommendation is based on inverse document frequency IDF of genres and pre-filtered by rating. The list outputs the top 10 that are mostly similar to that anime.


Conclusion
When inputting an anime title, it'll fetch animes that have similar genres to the inputted anime. The system will output a list of anime also showing their scores on MyAnimeList, the source type (Movie, Show, Manga), and the genres.
