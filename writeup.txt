## Introduction – Motivation
Anime has become a global phenomenon, with countless genres and titles catering to diverse tastes. However, the sheer volume of available options makes it challenging for viewers to discover anime aligned with their preferences. A recommendation system tailored to anime fans can streamline this process, creating personalized viewing experiences while promoting lesser-known titles.

## Problem Definition
The goal is to develop an effective anime recommendation algorithm using the MyAnimeList dataset.
This system should accurately predict user preferences based on historical data, such as ratings, genres, and user interactions.
The challenges include handling sparse data, capturing diverse user preferences, and ensuring scalability to accommodate a growing dataset.
